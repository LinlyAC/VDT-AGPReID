### Introduction
* CARGO is a large-scale aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) dataset, which captured from a synthesized scene in Unity3D.
* CARGO contains 13 cameras (8 ground and 5 aerial cameras), 5000 person ids, and 108563 person images.
* In the aerial camera area, two different drone roaming strategies are designed according to the size of the surveillance area. For the small area (left area), we deploy one drone with a $90^\circ$ overhead view, allowing it to move counterclockwise around each street. For a large area (right area), we deploy individual drones on each of the four streets with a $45^\circ\sim60^\circ$ tilt view, allowing them to move back and forth on corresponding streets.
