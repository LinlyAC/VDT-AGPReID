# VDT-AGPReID
View-decoupled Transformer for Person Re-identification under Aerial-ground Camera Network (CVPR'24)

## [0] Dataset: CARGO

### Introduction
* CARGO is a large-scale aerial-ground person re-identification (AGPReID) dataset, which captured from a synthesized scene in Unity3D.
* CARGO contains 13 cameras (8 ground and 5 aerial cameras), 5000 person IDs, and 108563 person images.
* **Camera 1 $\sim$ 5 belong to aerial cameras, and Camera 6 $\sim$ 13 belongs to ground cameras.**
* In the aerial camera area, two different drone roaming strategies are designed according to the size of the surveillance area. For the small area (left area), we deploy one drone with a $90^\circ$ overhead view, allowing it to move counterclockwise around each street. For a large area (right area), we deploy individual drones on each of the four streets with a $45^\circ\sim60^\circ$ tilt view, allowing them to move back and forth on corresponding streets.

### Setting
* We split CARGO into the train (51,451 images with 2500 IDs) and test sets (51,024 images with the remaining 2500 IDs) with an almost 1:1 ratio.
* **Testing Protocol 1 (ALL)** uses full test data and labels, which focuses on the comprehensive retrieval performance.
* **Testing Protocol 2 (G $\leftrightarrow$ G)** only retains the data under the ground camera in the test set (60 query IDs with 134 images, 2404 gallery IDs with 18,444 images).
* **Testing Protocol 3 (A $\leftrightarrow$ A)** only retains the data under the aerial camera in the test set (89 query IDs with 178 images, 2447 gallery IDs with 32,268 images).
* **Testing Protocol 4 (A $\leftrightarrow$ G)** relabels the original test set into two domains (aerial and ground domain) based on the camera label.
* The training set of all testing protocols retains same.

### Annotation
Annotations are preserved in the name of each image by the format ``camID_time_personID_index.jpg''. 

 For example, ``Cam2_day_2519_320.jpg'' means that:
* Camera id is 2, and it belongs to the aerial view.
* Capture time is day. (day or night)
* Person id is 2519.
* Index is 320. (It has no practical meaning for you.)
